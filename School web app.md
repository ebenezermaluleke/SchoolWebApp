# School web app 

## Introduction
* School web app is a platform that will be used by both students and teacher to make teaching environment interesting.
* I have discovered that during Covid-19 pandemic, lockdwon makes education more difficult for other people and this affect student perfomance.
* I have decided to come up with a plan on how to get intach with student to make ssure that they continue to learn while they are at home. This platform will be used for educational purposes only whereby only registered student will have access to materials

The following is what each student should do :
```bash
- student will have limited number of modules or subject
- student should be able to view and download learning materials
- student should be able to join live classes and access to offline vidoes
- student should be able to view marks but they cannot update the marks
- student should be able to see annoucements
- students should be able to submit assessments
```

## Teacher
The following is what the teacher will do :
```bash
- TEacher should be able to allocate students to a subject
- Teacher should be able to insert, update and delete marks
- TEacher should be able to post annoucements for student
- Teacher should be able to post and retrieve assessment
- Teacher should be able to post learning materials for student
